scene 1:
 1) both front and back of the dog's body was mapped by two faces, the body part use texture_vertexshader.txt and texture_fragmentshader.txt. Rotate the dog use either 'K' or 'L'.

 2) the leg part of dog use stripe_vertexshader.txt and stripe_fragmentshader.txt, initially

 3) the rest part of the dog use vertexshader.txt and fragmentshader.txt

 4) the ground plane use board_vertexshader.txt and board_fragmentshader.txt, inially

 5) initially the leg has stripes and the ground plane is a checkerboard, press g to switch shaders for the leg and ground plane.

scene 2:

 1) the dog is semi-transparent, rest of the scene not. The drawing order is torus->plane->dog

 2) if the dog is rotated, the transparency effect will be messed up. Rotate the dog to its original position to see the transparency.

 3) the scene use vertexshader.txt and fragmentshader.txt

scene 3:

 1) the scene use texture_vertexshader.txt and texture_fragmentshader.txt

 2) press 't' to toggle betweeen wood texture and marble texture.

 3) press 'n' to turn on bump mapping, must zoom in to see the result
